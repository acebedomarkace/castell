It's most interesting when you put `RQI's (Radio Quality Indicators)` side by side and see how they influence your throughput. The following table serves to illustrate the range of throughput fluctuations per bandwidth at varying radio conditions:

At extremely low `CQI` ranges, equivalent to poor radio interface quality, the fluctuations are rather large (10%-30%) representing a very bad perceived experience in terms of throughput. It is therefore suggested that for `CQI` targets should be set around `CQI=10` to guarantee excellent subscriber experience.
