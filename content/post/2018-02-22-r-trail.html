<p>Leaving an R Trail is what I am set to do. Having done my first <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/">flexdashboard</a> in RMarkdown and looking at that gorgeous, modern-feel, professional, expensive looking report not to mention the availability of R under the hood - I am fully persuaded that I will be an R person from here on - and an R Studio fan!… <em>they just make the coolest stuff</em>. My first R script was created last November, that is <code>107</code> days up to the day of this post and I must say that my interest for doing everything in R has not waned. With R, I feel like I can once again take on Fast Fourier Transforms, Differential Equations, Differential/Integral Calculus, being trained in the engineering field, well I guess that kicks in naturally having a love for the physical sciences, but I feel like moving into the much-hyped ML (Machine Learning), not to add to its hype-“ness” but to actually ground it to practical and useful applications in the industry where I find myself in, and I wish to track my progress here.</p>
<p>The <strong><code>R Trail</code></strong> is something that I wanted to leave behind for my future self - or for anyone interested to have a similar extraordinary adventure of getting things done in R - RStudio style. It would just consist of some notes, formulas and/or refence links to resources that helped me do successfully what I needed to do. As of this writing I may be properly called an <code>R Evangelist</code> advocating <code>data literacy</code> and a <code>data-driven decision making culture</code> for all who loves to make sense out of and answer their questions using real world data.</p>
