<p><strong><em>Coverage has great impact on LTE subscriber experience</em></strong> when one considers <code>Gap Measurement</code> occurrences in a highly mobile environment where handover happens due to coverage limitation. It can be said that the number of gap measurement occurences is a measure of the coverage continuity of a cluster - if extended, coverage continuity of an LTE network.</p>
<p>Coverage assessment could be effectively done using the <code>RATA (Random Access per Timing Advance)</code> indices. Below is an illustration of a cluster coverage assessment using these counters:</p>

<p>When this is taken in connection with the following figure,</p>

<p>One can have the following observations;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On the average, the main lobe of the antennas are directed at the <code>234-546m</code> range which corresponds to RATA2 (L.RA.TA.UE.Index2).</p></li>
<li><p>the effective coverage is from <code>156m-1950m</code> (approx. 2kms!, if this is on a CBD then definitely sector coverage is overshooting).</p></li>
<li><p>assuming that you have a 20m antenna height covering the effective linear range as indicated above, on the average, you have a 4-6DEG antenna downtilt standard setting for all sectors.</p></li>
<li><p>L1800 and L2600 coverage are perfectly coincident, therefore balancing can be effectively done between these layers, a push to L26 initiative would be a potential direction with great benefits to subscriber experience.</p></li>
<li><p>L700 is definitely not coincident with the other layers, which presents some potential problem, it could be due to a sparse deployment or a different coverage intention other than the two but most definitely overshooting just like L18 and L26.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>See, just by looking into these figures one can have insight on the actual network coverage extent of the LTE sites.</p>
