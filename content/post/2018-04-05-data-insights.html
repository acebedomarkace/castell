<p>I just had to blog on these key take aways from Freelance Analytics Meetup. For freelance gigs visit alpha-zetta.net. Great books! 1) Small Data by Martin Lindstrom 2) Dataâ€™ism 3) Putting your data to work</p>
<p>Actionable Analytics:</p>
<p>Regression Analysis - for measuring magnitude and trend Logistic Regression - measuring probability or likelihood Clustering - similarities and groupings Survival Analysis - determining the time to an event Event Analysis - understanding sequences of complex events Network Analysis - determining the connections between entities</p>
<p>Kahoot.it = rocks!</p>
