<p>While there is the determined attempt of the technical world - experts,consultants, technical advisers, academic institutions in creating data science courses, offering data science services to monetize and capitalize on the current data science “hype”, reading a blog like <a href="https://fronkonstin.com">Fronkonstin</a> created by Antonio Sánchez Chinchón of Telefonica - featured in a Data Camp course on <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/projects/62?utm_medium=fb%2Cig%2Can%2Cms-all&amp;utm_source=fb_paid&amp;utm_campaign=smartly_ppa&amp;utm_id=5a9dcd6da5ec6c214b2cb7c5">phyllotaxiz</a>, for someone like me who thinks and breathes R, it’s just a ‘breath of fresh air’.</p>
<p>Looking at the monstrous detail of the visualization in a short amount of <a href="https://github.com/aschinchon/mandalas-colored">code</a>,</p>

<p>Just inspires me to keep exploring and doing things in R - this also eclipses my gaze at the python track, from this point on #IuseR -exclusively.</p>
<p>While doing this blog I came across <a href="https://hub.docker.com">Docker Hub</a>… yet to read up on this, seems filled with some serious neat tech stuff. I just recalled <a href="https://flowingdata.com">Flowing Data</a> as well, my first source or R amazement with regard to the language’s application.</p>
