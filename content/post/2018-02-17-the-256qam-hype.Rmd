Everyone gets excited everytime a feature comes out especially those that claims to improve the subscriber experience in terms of throughput by a factor of 50%-100%. **Question is: Under the same radio conditions can `256QAM` deliver on its promise?**

First, it's definitely handset capability dependent. The phones that support such capability would be, at the minimum, the Galaxy S8 - and all the succeeding high-end batches. Practically we're looking at less than 1% of all the LTE capable mobile handsets out there - well, at least as of this writing. Probably it is for another set of devices at home in the future. But it certainly gives the hype - at least for now. But for curious RF Engineers out there, have a look at the following figure and realize that it is still the task of securing a good radio access interface quality which will quarantee that 256QAM will actually work for the subscribers. `CQI=10` is the top of mind target across the board!.

Figure above shows the default and the alt-cqi table (used for 256QAM) compared side-by-side under the same radio conditions. It could be observed that `256QAM` implementation assigns larger transport blocks to deliver higher speed - and that is all that it does... period.
