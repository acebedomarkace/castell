<p>Itâ€™s most interesting when you put <code>RQI's (Radio Quality Indicators)</code> side by side and see how they influence your throughput. The following table serves to illustrate the range of throughput fluctuations per bandwidth at varying radio conditions:</p>

<p>At extremely low <code>CQI</code> ranges, equivalent to poor radio interface quality, the fluctuations are rather large (10%-30%) representing a very bad perceived experience in terms of throughput. It is therefore suggested that for <code>CQI</code> targets should be set around <code>CQI=10</code> to guarantee excellent subscriber experience.</p>
